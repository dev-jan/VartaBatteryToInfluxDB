# Varta Battery to InfluxDB Logger

This is a simple data logger to log metrics from Varta batteries to an InfluxDB.


## How to use it?

The simplest way to use it is via Docker-compose. See the docker-compose.yml file
in this Repo as example (remove the fakeVartaBattery and change the URL of the
vartalogger to the real battery).
